# WeatherWear


## Description
Our group set out to create an application that allows its user to enter a location, date, and clothing style and then recieve the projected weather along with suggestions of what to wear.
We were able to create this application using the past few months of classes, teamwork, and a bit of intsructor guidance to build a site that meets the previously mentioned goal aswell as meets the following criteria:
<ul>
<li> 2 server-side APIs utilized
<li> A CSS framework that isn't Bootstrap used
<li> Client-side storage available
<li> A Polished UI presented
<li> Quallity coding standards met
<li> NO alerts, confirms, or prompts are used (only modals)
<li> Application is interactive not static
<li> Deployed from GitHub pages


## Usage
When a user clicks on the first link below they are brought to a page resembling the following screenshot, and they are able to then select a clothing style, select dates they wish to dress for, and input a location.
The user will then be presented with the current weather conditions for the searched for location aswell as 6 photo suggestions of clothing suitable for that weather.
